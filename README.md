# AuctionApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4. In this project every new opening client is one of the auction participant and new user with web socket. Second-price auction rule applies in this auction.

## Server side

Run app.js for server side.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#Note:

Before you run the project please run `ng install` and make sure there is a MongoDB installed on your pc. MongoDB connection is at app.js file so you can change the connection url. At least create the database. App.js will handle the rest of it.
